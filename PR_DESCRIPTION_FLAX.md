# Pull Request: Flax Kernel Integration

## Overview
This pull request introduces the design document for integrating the Flax library into the custom kernel. The goal is to adapt the Flax `Module` class and its methods to operate within the kernel environment, allowing neural network models defined using Flax to be executed in kernel mode.

## Key Components
1. **Module Class Adaptation**: Modify the `Module` class to interface with kernel-level APIs and manage state within the kernel environment.
2. **Compatibility Layer**: Develop a compatibility layer that translates Flax's operations into kernel-level instructions.
3. **State Management**: Ensure that the state of Flax modules is managed correctly within the kernel, including initialization, execution, and cleanup.
4. **Submodule Handling**: Adapt the handling of submodules to work within the constraints of the kernel environment.
5. **Method Execution**: Ensure that methods such as `__call__` and `setup` can be executed within the kernel, with appropriate state management and error handling.

## Design Details
The design document outlines the following key components and changes needed to achieve the integration:
- Module Class Adaptation
- Compatibility Layer
- State Management
- Submodule Handling
- Method Execution

## Conclusion
The integration of the Flax library into the custom kernel involves adapting the `Module` class and its methods to operate within the kernel environment. This requires developing a compatibility layer, managing state correctly, handling submodules, and ensuring that methods can be executed within the kernel. The proposed design outlines the key components and changes needed to achieve this integration.
