# Pull Request: Add Detailed Logging to dev_write Function for Debugging

## Summary
This pull request addresses the following changes:
- Adds detailed logging to the `dev_write` function in `tensorflow_lite_kernel_interpreter.c` for debugging segmentation faults.

## Changes
### `tensorflow_lite_kernel_interpreter.c`
- Added detailed logging to the `dev_write` function to log the values of pointers before they are dereferenced and the sizes of buffers before they are accessed.

## Testing
- The `tensorflow_model_execution_test.sh` script will be used to test the changes. It includes logging system resource usage before and after loading the model, executing the model, and retrieving the results.

## Next Steps
- Review the changes and ensure that the detailed logging is correctly implemented.
- Test the `tensorflow_model_execution_test.sh` script to verify the changes.
