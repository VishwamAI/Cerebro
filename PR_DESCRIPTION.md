# Pull Request: Optimize Memory Allocation and Improve Error Handling in dev_write Function

## Summary
This pull request addresses the following changes:
- Optimizes memory allocation in the `dev_write` function in `tensorflow_lite_kernel_interpreter.c` to reduce unnecessary allocations.
- Ensures proper mutex handling to prevent potential deadlocks.
- Improves error handling to return appropriate error codes when an error occurs.

## Changes
### `tensorflow_lite_kernel_interpreter.c`
- Modified the `dev_write` function to only allocate `result_buffer` and `temp_buffer` when necessary for the operation being performed.
- Ensured that `kernel_buffer` is only allocated once and reused, rather than being allocated every time `dev_write` is called.
- Reviewed the mutex locking and unlocking to ensure that the mutex is always released, even if the function exits early.
- Updated the error handling to return appropriate error codes when an error occurs, rather than the length of `kernel_buffer`.

## Testing
- The `tensorflow_model_execution_test.sh` script will be used to test the changes. It includes logging system resource usage before and after loading the model, executing the model, and retrieving the results.

## Next Steps
- Review the changes and ensure that the memory allocation and error handling optimizations are correctly implemented.
- Test the `tensorflow_model_execution_test.sh` script to verify the changes.
