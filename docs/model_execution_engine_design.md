# Model Execution Engine Design

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed design for the Model Execution Engine within the Cerebro kernel. The goal is to enable the loading and execution of TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models natively within the kernel environment. The engine will support custom code for model execution, without relying on TensorFlow's API.

## Objectives
- Develop a kernel module for loading and executing TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models.
- Implement custom code for model execution.
- Ensure compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.

## Components
The Model Execution Engine will consist of the following components:
1. **Model Loader**: Responsible for loading models from user space into the kernel.
2. **Model Executor**: Responsible for executing the loaded models within the kernel.
3. **Result Retriever**: Responsible for retrieving the results of model execution and returning them to user space.

### Model Loader
The Model Loader will be responsible for:
- Loading models from user space.
- Storing the loaded models in kernel memory.

#### Loading Logic
- Read the model file from the specified path.
- Allocate kernel memory for the model.
- Load the model data into the allocated memory.

### Model Executor
The Model Executor will be responsible for:
- Executing the loaded models within the kernel.
- Managing the execution context and resources.

#### Execution Logic
- Initialize the execution context for the model.
- Execute the model using custom code.
- Manage the execution resources and handle any errors.

### Result Retriever
The Result Retriever will be responsible for:
- Retrieving the results of model execution.
- Returning the results to user space.

#### Retrieval Logic
- Access the execution context to retrieve the results.
- Format the results for user space consumption.
- Return the results to user space through the IPC mechanism.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Model Loader**:
   - Develop the loading logic for TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models.
   - Implement memory allocation and data loading for models.

2. **Model Executor**:
   - Develop the execution logic for TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models.
   - Implement custom code for model execution and resource management.

3. **Result Retriever**:
   - Develop the retrieval logic for model execution results.
   - Implement result formatting and return mechanisms.

## Conclusion
This detailed design document provides the specifications for the Model Execution Engine within the Cerebro kernel. The next steps involve implementing the loading, execution, and retrieval logic for TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models, followed by testing and optimization to ensure compatibility and performance.
