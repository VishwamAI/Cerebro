# File Type Handlers Design

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed design for the File Type Handlers within the Cerebro kernel. The goal is to enable the execution of .deb, .exe, and .apk files natively within the kernel environment. Each file type will have a dedicated handler module responsible for parsing, loading, and executing the files.

## Objectives
- Develop modules for handling .deb, .exe, and .apk files.
- Implement file parsing, loading, and execution logic for each file type.
- Ensure compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.

## Components
The File Type Handlers will consist of the following components:
1. **.deb File Handler**: Module for handling Debian package files.
2. **.exe File Handler**: Module for handling Windows executable files.
3. **.apk File Handler**: Module for handling Android package files.

### .deb File Handler
The .deb File Handler will be responsible for:
- Parsing the Debian package format.
- Extracting the package contents.
- Loading and executing the package within the kernel environment.

#### Parsing Logic
- Read the .deb file header to identify the package metadata.
- Extract the control and data archives from the package.
- Parse the control archive to retrieve package information.

#### Loading and Execution Logic
- Load the extracted files into the appropriate locations within the kernel.
- Execute the package scripts and binaries.

### .exe File Handler
The .exe File Handler will be responsible for:
- Parsing the Windows executable format (PE format).
- Extracting the executable sections.
- Loading and executing the executable within the kernel environment.

#### Parsing Logic
- Read the PE file header to identify the executable metadata.
- Extract the sections from the PE file.
- Parse the section headers to retrieve section information.

#### Loading and Execution Logic
- Load the extracted sections into the appropriate locations within the kernel.
- Execute the entry point of the executable.

### .apk File Handler
The .apk File Handler will be responsible for:
- Parsing the Android package format.
- Extracting the package contents.
- Loading and executing the package within the kernel environment.

#### Parsing Logic
- Read the APK file header to identify the package metadata.
- Extract the APK contents, including the manifest, resources, and compiled code.
- Parse the manifest to retrieve package information.

#### Loading and Execution Logic
- Load the extracted files into the appropriate locations within the kernel.
- Execute the package's main activity.

## Implementation Plan
1. **.deb File Handler**:
   - Develop the parsing logic for .deb files.
   - Implement the loading and execution logic for .deb packages.

2. **.exe File Handler**:
   - Develop the parsing logic for .exe files.
   - Implement the loading and execution logic for .exe executables.

3. **.apk File Handler**:
   - Develop the parsing logic for .apk files.
   - Implement the loading and execution logic for .apk packages.

## Conclusion
This detailed design document provides the specifications for the File Type Handlers within the Cerebro kernel. The next steps involve implementing the parsing, loading, and execution logic for each file type, followed by testing and optimization to ensure compatibility and performance.
