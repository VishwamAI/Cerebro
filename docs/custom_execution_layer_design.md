# Custom Execution Layer Design

## Introduction
This document outlines the high-level design for a custom execution layer within the Cerebro kernel. The goal is to enable the execution of .deb, .exe, and .apk files natively within the kernel environment, without relying on external compatibility layers or emulation tools. This design will also integrate TensorFlow models, Google's JAX library, and the Flax library for advanced machine learning capabilities.

## Objectives
- Execute .deb, .exe, and .apk files within the kernel.
- Integrate and execute TensorFlow models without using TensorFlow's API.
- Support for natural language processing tasks.
- Compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.
- Integration with Google's JAX and Flax libraries for advanced machine learning capabilities.

## High-Level Architecture
The custom execution layer will consist of the following components:
1. **File Type Handlers**: Modules responsible for interpreting and executing .deb, .exe, and .apk files.
2. **Model Execution Engine**: A kernel module for loading and executing TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models.
3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanism**: Device files for communication between user space and kernel space.
4. **Configuration Interface**: Sysfs entries for configuring model paths and execution options.

### File Type Handlers
Each file type (.deb, .exe, .apk) will have a dedicated handler module within the kernel. These handlers will:
- Parse the file format.
- Extract and load the necessary components.
- Execute the file within the kernel environment.

### Model Execution Engine
The model execution engine will be responsible for:
- Loading models from user space.
- Executing models within the kernel.
- Returning results to user space.

The engine will support TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax models, with custom code for model execution.

### IPC Mechanism
Device files will be used as the IPC mechanism for communication between user space and kernel space. The following commands will be supported:
- `LOAD_MODEL`: Load a model from a specified path.
- `EXECUTE_MODEL`: Execute the loaded model.
- `GET_RESULTS`: Retrieve the results of the model execution.

### Configuration Interface
The configuration interface will provide sysfs entries for:
- Setting the model path.
- Configuring preprocessing and postprocessing options.

## Implementation Plan
1. **File Type Handlers**:
   - Develop modules for .deb, .exe, and .apk file handling.
   - Implement file parsing, loading, and execution logic.

2. **Model Execution Engine**:
   - Develop the kernel module for model execution.
   - Implement custom code for TensorFlow, JAX, and Flax model execution.

3. **IPC Mechanism**:
   - Create device files for communication.
   - Implement command handling logic in the `dev_write` function.

4. **Configuration Interface**:
   - Implement sysfs entries for model configuration.
   - Develop logic for setting and retrieving configuration options.

## Conclusion
This design document provides a high-level overview of the custom execution layer for the Cerebro kernel. The next steps involve detailed implementation of each component, followed by testing and optimization to ensure the kernel meets the user's requirements.
