# Configuration Interface Design

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed design for the Configuration Interface within the Cerebro kernel. The goal is to expose configuration options to user space via sysfs, allowing for dynamic configuration of the kernel module's behavior.

## Objectives
- Develop sysfs entries for configuring the kernel module.
- Implement read and write operations for the sysfs entries.
- Ensure compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.

## Components
The Configuration Interface will consist of the following components:
1. **Sysfs Entries**: Special files in the sysfs filesystem used for configuration.
2. **Configuration Handler**: Responsible for processing read and write operations on the sysfs entries.

### Sysfs Entries
The sysfs entries will be responsible for:
- Exposing configuration options to user space.
- Allowing user space to read and modify configuration options.

#### Sysfs Entry Operations
- **Read**: Read the current value of a configuration option.
- **Write**: Modify the value of a configuration option.

### Configuration Handler
The Configuration Handler will be responsible for:
- Processing read and write operations on the sysfs entries.
- Updating the kernel module's behavior based on the configuration options.

#### Supported Configuration Options
- `model_path`: Path to the model file to be loaded.
- `preprocessing_options`: Options for preprocessing the input data.
- `postprocessing_options`: Options for postprocessing the output data.

#### Configuration Handling Logic
- **Read Operation**:
  - Retrieve the current value of the configuration option.
  - Return the value to user space.
- **Write Operation**:
  - Read the new value from user space.
  - Update the configuration option with the new value.
  - Apply the new configuration to the kernel module.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Sysfs Entries**:
   - Create sysfs entries for `model_path`, `preprocessing_options`, and `postprocessing_options`.
   - Implement read and write operations for the sysfs entries.

2. **Configuration Handler**:
   - Develop the configuration handling logic for reading and writing configuration options.
   - Implement the actions for updating the kernel module's behavior based on the configuration options.

## Conclusion
This detailed design document provides the specifications for the Configuration Interface within the Cerebro kernel. The next steps involve implementing the sysfs entries and configuration handling logic, followed by testing and optimization to ensure compatibility and performance.
