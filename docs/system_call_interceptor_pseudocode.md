# System Call Interceptor Pseudocode

## Introduction
This document outlines the high-level pseudocode for the System Call Interceptor component. The purpose of this component is to intercept system calls made by .deb, .exe, and .apk files and redirect them to the Translation Layer.

## Pseudocode

### System Call Interceptor

1. **Initialize Interceptor**
   - Set up the environment for intercepting system calls.
   - Load necessary libraries and dependencies.

2. **Intercept System Calls**
   - Monitor system calls made by .deb, .exe, and .apk files.
   - Capture the details of each intercepted system call (e.g., call type, arguments).

3. **Redirect to Translation Layer**
   - For each intercepted system call:
     - Pass the captured details to the Translation Layer for processing.

4. **Handle Errors**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to manage any issues that arise during interception or redirection.

5. **Log Interception Events**
   - Maintain a log of intercepted system calls for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Example Flow

1. **Initialize Interceptor**
   ```
   initialize_interceptor()
   ```

2. **Intercept System Calls**
   ```
   while (true) {
       system_call = intercept_system_call()
       if (system_call) {
           redirect_to_translation_layer(system_call)
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Redirect to Translation Layer**
   ```
   function redirect_to_translation_layer(system_call) {
       // Pass the system call details to the Translation Layer
       translation_layer.process(system_call)
   }
   ```

4. **Handle Errors**
   ```
   function handle_error(error) {
       // Log the error and take appropriate action
       log_error(error)
       recover_from_error()
   }
   ```

5. **Log Interception Events**
   ```
   function log_interception_event(system_call) {
       // Log the details of the intercepted system call
       log(system_call)
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
The pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the System Call Interceptor's logic. The next step is to translate this pseudocode into actual code and integrate it with the custom kernel.
