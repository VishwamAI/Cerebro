# IPC Mechanism Design

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed design for the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanism within the Cerebro kernel. The goal is to enable communication between user space and kernel space using device files. This mechanism will facilitate the loading, execution, and result retrieval of models within the kernel.

## Objectives
- Develop device files for communication between user space and kernel space.
- Implement command handling logic for loading, executing, and retrieving results of models.
- Ensure compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.

## Components
The IPC Mechanism will consist of the following components:
1. **Device Files**: Special files used for communication between user space and kernel space.
2. **Command Handler**: Responsible for processing commands sent through the device files.

### Device Files
The device files will be responsible for:
- Receiving commands from user space.
- Sending responses and results back to user space.

#### Device File Operations
- **Open**: Open the device file for communication.
- **Read**: Read data from the device file.
- **Write**: Write commands to the device file.
- **Release**: Close the device file.

### Command Handler
The Command Handler will be responsible for:
- Processing commands sent through the device files.
- Executing the appropriate actions based on the commands.

#### Supported Commands
- `LOAD_MODEL`: Load a model from a specified path.
- `EXECUTE_MODEL`: Execute the loaded model.
- `GET_RESULTS`: Retrieve the results of the model execution.

#### Command Handling Logic
- **LOAD_MODEL**:
  - Read the model path from the command.
  - Load the model into kernel memory.
- **EXECUTE_MODEL**:
  - Execute the loaded model.
  - Store the results in kernel memory.
- **GET_RESULTS**:
  - Retrieve the results from kernel memory.
  - Send the results back to user space.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Device Files**:
   - Create device files for communication.
   - Implement open, read, write, and release operations.

2. **Command Handler**:
   - Develop the command handling logic for `LOAD_MODEL`, `EXECUTE_MODEL`, and `GET_RESULTS`.
   - Implement the actions for loading, executing, and retrieving results of models.

## Conclusion
This detailed design document provides the specifications for the IPC Mechanism within the Cerebro kernel. The next steps involve implementing the device files and command handling logic, followed by testing and optimization to ensure compatibility and performance.
