# JAX Kernel Compatibility Layer Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for integrating the JAX library into the custom kernel. The goal is to adapt JAX's operations to operate within the kernel environment, allowing neural network models defined using JAX to be executed in kernel mode.

## Key Components
1. **Operation Adaptation**: Modify JAX operations to interface with kernel-level APIs and manage state within the kernel environment.
2. **Compatibility Layer**: Develop a compatibility layer that translates JAX's operations into kernel-level instructions.
3. **State Management**: Ensure that the state of JAX operations is managed correctly within the kernel, including initialization, execution, and cleanup.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide clear error messages and manage exceptions within the kernel.
5. **Method Execution**: Ensure that JAX functions can be executed within the kernel, with appropriate state management and error handling.

### Operation Adaptation
JAX operations need to be adapted to interface with kernel-level APIs. This involves:

- **Initialization**: Modify the initialization process to set up the necessary state for kernel execution.
- **State Management**: Adapt the state management to handle state within the kernel environment.
- **Execution**: Ensure that JAX operations can be executed within the kernel, using kernel-level APIs for memory management and execution.

### Compatibility Layer
The compatibility layer will translate JAX's operations into kernel-level instructions. This involves:

- **Method Wrapping**: Wrap JAX functions to manage state and handle errors within the kernel.
- **State Management**: Ensure that the state of JAX operations is correctly managed across method calls and execution boundaries.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide clear error messages and manage exceptions within the kernel.

### State Management
State management is crucial for ensuring that JAX operations operate correctly within the kernel. This involves:

- **Initialization**: Ensure that operations are properly initialized with the necessary state for kernel execution.
- **Execution**: Manage the state of operations during execution, including handling intermediate states and managing memory.
- **Cleanup**: Ensure that the state is correctly cleaned up after execution to prevent memory leaks and other issues.

### Error Handling
Error handling is essential for providing clear error messages and managing exceptions within the kernel. This involves:

- **Error Detection**: Implement mechanisms to detect errors during the execution of JAX operations.
- **Error Reporting**: Provide clear error messages to help diagnose issues within the kernel.
- **Exception Management**: Manage exceptions to ensure that the kernel remains stable and operational.

### Method Execution
Methods such as `jax.jit` and `jax.grad` are central to the operation of JAX. To ensure that these methods can be executed within the kernel:

- **Method Wrapping**: Wrap methods to manage state and handle errors within the kernel.
- **State Management**: Ensure that the state is correctly managed across method calls and execution boundaries.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide clear error messages and manage exceptions within the kernel.

## Conclusion
The integration of the JAX library into the custom kernel involves adapting JAX operations to operate within the kernel environment. This requires developing a compatibility layer, managing state correctly, handling errors, and ensuring that methods can be executed within the kernel. The proposed design outlines the key components and changes needed to achieve this integration.
