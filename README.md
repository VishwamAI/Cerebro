# Cerebro

## Introduction
Cerebro is a unique custom kernel designed to execute .deb, .exe, and .apk files on one platform. It integrates TensorFlow models and supports natural language processing tasks, providing a powerful environment for automation and machine learning applications.

## Features
- Execute .deb, .exe, and .apk files within the kernel.
- Integrate and execute TensorFlow models without using TensorFlow's API.
- Support for natural language processing tasks.
- Compatibility with x86, x64, and Android systems.
- Integration with Google's JAX and Flax libraries for advanced machine learning capabilities.

## Installation
To install the Cerebro kernel, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/Cerebro.git
   cd Cerebro
   ```

2. Build the kernel:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Install the kernel modules:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

## Usage
### Loading and Executing Models
To load and execute a model within the Cerebro kernel, use the following commands:

1. Load a model:
   ```bash
   echo "LOAD_MODEL /path/to/model" > /dev/flax_device
   ```

2. Execute the model:
   ```bash
   echo "EXECUTE_MODEL" > /dev/flax_device
   ```

3. Retrieve the results:
   ```bash
   cat /dev/flax_device
   ```
